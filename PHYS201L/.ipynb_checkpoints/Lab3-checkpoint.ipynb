    "4. Use Equation $\\eqref{eq:x_of_t}$ to determine the time, $\\Delta t$, for a ball released from rest, ($v_{oy} = 0 m/s$), to fall the vertical distance, $\\Delta y$, to the floor. \n",

    "5. Because the horizontal and vertical components for projectile motion are independent, the time for a ball fired horizontally from the table to reach the floor is the same as that calculated in step 4. Use Equation $\\eqref{eq:theo_range}$ to predict the horizontal distance, $\\Delta x$, that the ball will travel in this time. Note that the initial horizontal velocity, $v_{ox}$, will be the “muzzle velocity” found earlier. This distance is called the range, R. Show your work in your Sample Calculations section.\n",
